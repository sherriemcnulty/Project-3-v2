## Description

Products R Us is a full-stack React application delployed over Heroku that utilizes HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, Bootstrap 4, Axios, MySQL and React.

This project is a practical demonstration of our ability to navigate the interplay between an online customer-facing store and the needs of a store manager to control and monitor stock. A customer and a store manager can be interacting with our MySQL database and the results of their choices will be reflected in the information shown to one another in real time.

Products R Us customers will be able to:

- Log in and have their login information stored on the browser.
- View all of the products in our database.
- Search for a specific product by name or a range of products within their budget range.
- Add items to a shopping cart where they will see the total price of their selections.
- Purchase items (and have these items deducted from the Products R Us stock)

Product R Us also offfers a Store Manager portal that gives managers the ability to:

- Search their inventory for products by name, category or department.
- View sales data to track the pricing information and performance of their items and offers online. This includes the ability to track which items are generating the most sales and which are generating clicks but aren't converting.
- Update the sale status of an item and change its sale price.
- Update any existing product listing in the database.
- Add new products to the Storefront page on receiving new shipments.
- Update a product's stock levels based on in-store sales or new stock arrivals.
- Delete a product from the Storefront.
